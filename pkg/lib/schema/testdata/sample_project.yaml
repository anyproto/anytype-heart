# Project Overview

The Anytype Schema System project aims to provide a robust and extensible way to define custom object types and their properties. This will enable users to create structured data models that fit their specific needs.

## Key Features

1. **Schema Definition Format**: JSON-based schema files that define object types and their relations
2. **Property Resolution**: Automatic mapping of property names to relation keys
3. **Format Detection**: Smart detection of property formats (date, URL, email, etc.)
4. **Integration Points**: Clean interfaces for integrating with import/export systems
